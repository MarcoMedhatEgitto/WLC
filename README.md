# Real-Time Compiler

## Description
This is a real-time HTML, CSS, and JavaScript compiler that allows users to write and preview code instantly. The application includes an integrated code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it dynamically updates the preview in an embedded iframe as you type. It also includes the ability to save the current code into separate files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) for download.

## Features
- Real-time preview for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Customizable view for showing one or more code windows.
- Option to save HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to separate files.
- Predictive text suggestions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on user input.
- Supports a variety of HTML, CSS, and JS elements for autocomplete.
- Responsive interface with clear labels for easy use.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (supports modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. The app should be ready to use.

## Usage
- **Write Code**: Type your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into the corresponding text areas.
- **Preview**: The preview of your code will update automatically in the iframe on the right.
- **Save Code**: Click the **Save It** button to download the code in separate files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`).
- **Customize View**: Use the dropdown to select whether you want to display only HTML, CSS, JS, or all code sections.
  
## Features Breakdown
### Code Editing:

### Word Suggestions:
- The app provides word suggestions while typing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the context. This helps speed up coding and avoid errors.
